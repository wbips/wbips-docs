# Improvement Proposals

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  While this document and some proposals are a work-in-progress, it can be used
  in production in agreement with wallets implementing the standard. The
  thinking behind this is to use, test, and iterate on proposals in a real-world
  environment. There should not be a burden of waiting for some ratification
  criteria or 100% consensus.

## Motivation for WBIPs

> **tl;dr** Make it easier for developers to build BTC enabled experiences!

- Single interface for BTC and L2s, without the need for new interfaces in the future
  - `window.WalletProvider` as the location for the global interface
  - Use namespaces in method strings to denote L2s (e.g. "lbtc*" for Liquid wrapped Bitcoin, "ln*" for lightning, "stx\*" for Stacks)
  - `.request` API which is future proof, without needing new specs or updates on the provider implementation
  - Standardized JSON API for alternatives communication channels (e.g. WalletConnect)
  - Simple and dynamic interface (i.e. not static methods, but rather dynamic strings and JSON objects)
- Removal of bloat observed in other systems
  - e.g. Ethereum's web3.js (with its reliance on many dependencies to initialize)
  - e.g. Stacks Connect (with its outdated success/error callbacks, unnecessary JWT wrapping and parameters)
- The user (via the wallet interface) should have more control over the actions than the web-app
  - e.g. the user should also be able to choose the network/chain/nonce, not the web-app alone

## Goals

- Get the community to come together as a working group on single JS API standard
  - Alby
  - Unisat
  - WebBTC
  - Leather
  - Xverse
  - Marketplaces (OpenOrdex, etc.)
  - Bifrost wallet
- Reduce extisting methods to essentials (for new API styles)
- Add WBIPs solving existing issues users/wallets/applications face
